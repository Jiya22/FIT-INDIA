                            <p>Maintaining a good level of physical fitness is important. However, it can be difficult
                                to determine what fitness entails.
                                Experts define physical fitness as “one’s ability to execute daily activities with
                                optimal performance, endurance, and strength with the management of disease, fatigue,
                                and stress and reduced sedentary behavior.”
                                This description goes beyond being able to run quickly or lift heavy weights. Despite
                                being important, these attributes only address single areas of fitness.
                                This article provides details of the five main components of physical fitness.
                            </p>
                            <p>People who regularly engage in these activities are more likelyTrusted Source to be
                                physically fit in terms of cardiorespiratory endurance. It is important to begin these
                                activities slowly and gradually increase the intensity over time.
                                Exercising increases cardiorespiratory endurance in a number of ways. For example, the
                                heart muscle becomes stronger so that it is able to pump more blood per heartbeat.
                                At the same time, additional small arteries grow within muscle tissue so that they can
                                deliver blood to working muscles more effectively when needed.

                            <p>Fitness can also include muscular endurance, which is the ability of a muscle to continue
                                exerting force without tiring.
                                As mentioned above, strength training builds bigger muscles. Endurance training, on the
                                other hand, does not necessarily generate muscles of a larger size.
                                This is because the body focuses more on the cardiovascular system, ensuring that the
                                muscles receive the oxygenated blood they need to keep functioning. Another important
                                change in muscles that people specifically train for endurance concerns the different
                                types of muscle tissue: fast twitch and slow twitchTrusted Source fibers.
                                Fast twitch fibers contract quickly but get tired quickly. They use a lot of energy and
                                are useful for sprints. They are whitish, as they do not require blood to function.
                                Slow twitch fibers are best for endurance work, as they can carry out tasks without
                                getting tired. They are present in core muscles. These fibers appear red, as they rely
                                on a good supply of oxygenated blood and contain stores of myoglobin.
                                Different exercises will promote fast twitch fibers, slow twitch fibers, or both. For
                                example, a sprinter will have comparatively more fast twitch fibers, whereas a long
                                distance runner will have more slow twitch fibers.</p>

                            <p>Muscles consist of elongated muscle cells. Each muscle cell containsTrusted Source
                                contractile proteins, called actin and myosin, that give the muscle its strength.
                                These fibers contract together, producing the so-called power stroke. The total force
                                depends on the number of these units contracting in unison.
                                To build muscle, an individual must regularly exercise their muscles and take in enough
                                protein.
                                Scientists do not fully understand the exact mechanism of muscle building, but the
                                general principles are well known. Training causes the muscle cellsTrusted Source to
                                expand, and there is an increase in actin and myosin production.
                                Also, in untrained muscles, fibers tend to fire in an asynchronous manner. In other
                                words, they do not fire in unison. As a person trains them, however, they learn to fire
                                together as one, thereby increasing maximum power output.
